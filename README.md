# Chewbotcca for Discord

Chewbotcca for Discord is back and better than ever!
It is completely re-written in Java using the JDA Discord API library.

It aims to be exactly what the [Legacy Discord bot was](https://github.com/Chewbotcca/Discord), and hopefully even better!

You can view commands [here](https://chew.pw/chewbotcca/discord/commands).

As usual, the goal of Chewbotcca isn't really to be the "best", its goal is to have features that I personally want in a Discord bot, and if you agree, you're free to add the bot yourself.

You can add the bot [with this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=604362556668248095&scope=bot&permissions=0)

You can join the Discord server with [this link](https://discord.gg/r583nHA).

I hope you enjoy the bot and want to improve it :)
